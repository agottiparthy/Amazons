Amazons Board Game + AI
Amazons is a board game played on a chessboard. Each player has 4 pieces which all move the same way a queen does in chess. Each turn, a player moves one of his 4 queens, and throws a spear from the queens end position. Spear throwing has the same rules as a queen move. Once a spear is thrown on a square, that square is inaccessible. The goal of the game is to trap all four of your opponents queens so that they cannot make any queen moves. This code includes a GUI to play.
